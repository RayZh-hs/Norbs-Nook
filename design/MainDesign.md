## Technical Manual

This part is dedicated to the maintainers of this project.
If technical details don't concern you, feel free to skip it.

### Overview

The project is structured as follows:

- **design**: all dev-time manuals and design scripts reside here.
- **generated**: contains all data that are procedurally generated by the software.
    - **data**: this folder contains data blocks used internally to store information
    - **logs**: this folder contains logs of runtime actions, system info, etc.
- **requirements**: requirements for this project. it shouldn't concern you.
- **src**: \[important\] all scripts reside here.
    - **backend**: contains cpp code used to manage and handle data.
    - **bridge**: contains python flask scripts to bridge the web frontend to the cpp backend.
    - **frontend**: contains web GUI-related files.
- **tests**: contains all tests.

Within the backend folder, the cpp files are divided as follows:

- **lib**: external libraries, self-built in earlier stages.
    - ***BlockList***: a library for efficient storing and retrieving of structured data.
- **static**: static files.
    - ***constants***: contains all constants for the project.
- ***account***: manages information about accounts.
- **bookkeeper**: manages information about books, purchases and restock.
- **logging**: manages the log files.
- **main**: builds on all else and provides User Interface Access Points.

### The Main Function

The main function relies on all the following classes:

- **AccountManager** (from account.hpp): for querying and managing accounts.
- **BookManager** (from bookkeeper.hpp): for maintaining book info in the shop.
- **ActionManager** (from bookkeeper.hpp): for maintaining actions.
- **Logger** (from logging.hpp): for creating logs and displaying them.
- **UserInterfaceHandler** (from main_cui.cpp): for handling user input/output.

### Database Design

- ***log.log***: for storing all-time logs
- ***global.dat***: for storing all global variables
- ***uid_info.dat***: mapping the unique-id to the information of a book, using a NaiveList.
- ***isbn_uid-head.dat, isbn_uid-body.dat***: mapping the isbn to the uid, with a BlockList.
- ***author_uid-head.dat, author_uid-body.dat***: mapping an author to the uid, with a BlockList.
- ***title_uid-head.dat, title_uid-body.dat***: mapping a title to the uid, with a BlockList.
- ***keyword_uid-head.dat, keyword_uid-body.dat***: mapping a keyword to the uid, with a BlockList.

### Class Design

Since a lot of classes have been depicted in detail above, I will here only cover those that bear importance but have not yet been covered.

- **NaiveList** (from NaiveList.hpp): Saves unordered structured data in a list in the disk.
- **BlockList** (from BlockList.hpp): Saves ordered structured data in a block list in the disk.
- **Account** (from account.hpp): Embodies information of an account.
- **Book** (from bookkeeper.hpp): Embodies information of a book.
- **Action** (from bookkeeper.hpp): Embodies information of an action performed, which needs to be documented.
- **Filter** (from bookkeeper.hpp): Embodies information of all components of a query.
- **UserInterfaceBase** (from main.hpp): A system that handles all user interfaces.
